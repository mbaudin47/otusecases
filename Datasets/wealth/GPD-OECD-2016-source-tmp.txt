Gross domestic product (GDP) at market prices is the expenditure on 
final goods and services minus imports: final consumption expenditures, 
gross capital formation, and exports less imports. "Gross" signifies 
that no deduction has been made for the depreciation of machinery, 
buildings and other capital products used in production. "Domestic" 
means that it is production by the resident institutional units of the 
country. The products refer to final goods and services, that is, those 
that are purchased, imputed or otherwise, as: final consumption of 
households, non-profit institutions serving households and government; 
fixed assets; and exports (minus imports). GDP per capita data are 
measured in US dollars at current prices and PPPs. GDP data are measured 
in million US dollars at current prices and PPPs. Data are 
internationally comparable across countries for any single year. All 
OECD countries compile their data according to the 2008 System of 
National Accounts (SNA).

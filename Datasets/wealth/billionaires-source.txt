Overview

Researchers have compiled a multi-decade database of the super-rich. 
Building off the Forbes World's Billionaires lists from 1996-2014, 
scholars at Peterson Institute for International Economics 
have added a couple dozen more variables about each billionaire - 
including whether they were self-made or inherited their wealth. 
(Roughly half of European billionaires and one-third of U.S. billionaires 
got a significant financial boost from family, the authors estimate.)
